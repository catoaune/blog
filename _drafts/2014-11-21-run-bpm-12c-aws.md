I'm very excited about [new Oracle Cloud service offering](https://cloud.oracle.com/build_apps) like Documents, Integration and Process.
But in the mindtime, I would like to try how to run SOA or BPM 12c in the cloud, and how to make this process easy.

After struggle with issues like how to upload a large installer, increase swap memory and how to install an Oracle database, I came out
with a solution.

These are some of the steps I follow to achieve it:

- Create a "storage" instance to share files using NFS
- Install Vagrant plug-in to create a cloud instance: vagrant-aws
- Install Vagrant plug-in to install Chef: vagrant-omnibus
- Create a Vagrant file using these plug-ins
- Create a script to extend swap space
- And add my BPM 12c recipes to install software and create a domain

To avoid a long post
