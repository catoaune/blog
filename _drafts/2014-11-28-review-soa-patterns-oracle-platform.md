I have the opportunity to present a review of this book [Applied SOA Patterns on the Oracle Platform](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/applied-soa-patterns-oracle-platform).

Once I started to check the chapters, I found it quite interesting because of these:

* Great introduction to SOA  principles, and Oracle SOA Suite evolution
* Align AIA Concepts with SOA patterns
* A key topic for SOA success: Service Repository
* An extend and complete description of Security and Error Handling

It's a really long book (572 pages) but is justified because it takes a great approach from concepts to examples with source code. This could help you to feel more confident about your SOA design decisions.

## Must Read parts

* Chapter 1 - SOA Frameworks: I think these frameworks are quite important to apply on SOA design, for example: Object and XML Modeling, if they are not designed well, could generate an implementation hell: huge data types, rare and non-descriptable names. Also gives an introduction to AIA that can give you a easy-to-learn guide about SOA layers, components, and common terms (Application Business Connector Services, Enterprise Business Flows and Services, and so on).

* Chapter 2 - Oracle SOA Roadmap: Owesome timeline about SOA Suite and related technologies. First time I found this information really well summarized. In general this chapter makes a great technical specification about Oracle SOA Foundation: artifacts, technologies, code examples, specifications.

* Chapter 3
